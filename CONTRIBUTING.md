## Contributions, updates and contact

Thanks for your interest in our project.

This repo is a partial copy of our internal repo. We try to update this repo whenever we cut a new
release. Your contributions are welcome, though. We don't run a public bugtracker at the moment, but
please feel free to contact us for all feedback, bugs, comments and requests at
`team-iga (at) deutschebahn.com`. This is also the address for security related issues.

You can also [open pull requests](pulls) to contribute code. We will integrate your code in our
internal main repository, and then publish it here when we release a new version. Of course, you will
be listed as a [contributor](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free environment. Be kind!
Please respect our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!
